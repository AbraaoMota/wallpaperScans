# wallpaperScans
This directory contains a simple script in Ruby that scans through the front-page of the wallpapers subreddit and downloads all of those in the 1st page. Places them in a subdirectory called pics, relative to the position of the script.

This was my first real attempt at using Ruby on my own. Thanks to the Nokogiri gem for the help with HTML connections.
